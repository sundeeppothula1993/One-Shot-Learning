# Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition - Face Recognition Application

## One Shot Learning:

One Shot Learning is all about learning to correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. For this particular tasks we can use siamese neural networks - which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity between inputs. This Archetechture overall uses Convelutional networks for feature exttraction and similarity measurements for object/face recognitions.
